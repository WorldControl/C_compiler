# C++ Compiler
A fairly simplistic C++ compiler made using flex and bison.

Compile the lex and yacc files, and make a 'demo.c' file
with a simeplistic C++ code of your choice.<br />
Try this for example -<br />
<br />
\#include\<iostream.h\> 
<br />
int main()<br />
{<br />
int a=5;<br />
return;<br />
}<br />
<br />
Go ahead and feel free to tinker with the grammar to try and understand
the full scope of this compiler, and its shortcomings(of which it has a sizeable amount),
and try to fix them if you can. I look forward to seeing you do amazing things with this.<br />
Warm Regards,<br />
Good Luck,<br />
Goodspeed.<br />
